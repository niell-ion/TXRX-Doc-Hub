## 3.1 Site Preparation

### Clearance

Measure the area where the controller will be installed. Refer to the following figure and table for minimum clearance dimensions:

| To Rail   | Vertical   | Horizontal   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 42 inches| 27 inches| 22 inches|

### Solar Panel

At the installation site, the sun should be directly visible from 10 AM - 3 PM, and not obstructed by structures, railcars, or foliage.

### Digging

Using a pickaxe, dig a path under the rail and around the ties for the liquid-tight tubing and controller stand.

## 3.2 Sensor Installation

### For Flip-Style Derail

1. Locate bracket on side of derail
2. Move derailer side to side, to the nearest and furthest extent, making sure sensor is clear of moving parts
3. Ensure sensor will be clear of wheels
4. Grind paint off of mating face of sensor bracket before welding
5. Weld sensor to derail 

### For Swing-Style Derail

1. Locate bracket on stand 
2. Bolt bracket to stand

### Liquid-Tight tubing

* Marmon provided

1. Measure between bracket to box
2. Cut tubing
3. Run cable through tubing from sensor to box
4. slide the bracket straight down on to the sensor
5. Move bracket forward and back to adjust
6. Once positioned, tighten top bolts to secure bracket
7. Connect sensor wire in box

### Mounting the Controller Stand

1. Center controller stand bracket on the tie
2. Move bracket towards rail as far as possible
3. Using at least 4 0.5" x 3" galvanized lag bolts with washers, attach the bracket to the tie
4. If not already attached, bolt the controller stand to the tie bracket
5. Ensure bolts are tightened, and that assembly is centered on the tie and square to the rail
6. Attach leveling feet using holes on bottom of bracket and tighten
7. Pre-load feet to prevent assembly from wobbling

### Connecting the Sensor

1. Center solar panel on spider bracket and fasten using provided M6 cage nuts
2. Bolt spider bracket, with solar panel attached, to solar panel mast

### Solar Panel Rotation

1. Place the slotted base of the solar panel mast onto the threaded stud pattern on the side of the device that receives more sun
2. Adjust solar panel rotation to desired angle
3. Ensure the light is not casting a shadow on the solar panel
4. Thread washers and 1/4"-20 nuts onto base studs and tighten
5. Adjust solar panel tilt to desired angle and tighten bolts

### Connecting the Solar Panel
