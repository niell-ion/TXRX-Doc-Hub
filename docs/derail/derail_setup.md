## 3.1 Derail Setup

### Preparing the Site

Measure the area where the controller will be installed. Refer to the following figure and table for minimum clearance dimensions:

#### Minimum Site Clearance 

| To Rail   | Vertical   | Horizontal   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 42 inches| 27 inches| 22 inches|

#### Solar Panel

From the hours of 10 AM - 3 PM, the sun should be directly visible without obstructions

### Positioning the Sensor

* Locate sensor bracket welded to derail device

> Bracket is previously installed. Mounting and welding instructions are not currently included within the scope of this document.

* Check that front of sensor is parallel to side face of derail device
* Slide the sensor in the slotted brack until it the face of the sensor is 3.5mm from the face of the derail

### Solar Panel Rotation

1. Place the solar panel pipe receiver onto the corresponding threaded stud pattern
2. Add the 1/4" washers to the studs, on top of the pipe receiver
3. Without tightenining, loosely thread the 1/4"-20 nuts 
4. Rotate the solar panel so it faces south, or nearest direction recieving full sun
5. Ensure the light is not casting a shadow on the solar panel
6. Fully tighten down the 1/4"-20 nuts

### Solar Panel Tilt

1. Locate the bolts mounting the solar panel to the bracket
2. Loosen the bolts and tilt the solar panel to the desired angle for maximum sun
3. Tighten the bolts until they are secure
