## 3.1 Site Preparation

### Clearance

Measure the area where the controller will be installed. Refer to the following figure and table for minimum clearance dimensions:

| To Rail   | Vertical   | Horizontal   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 42 inches| 27 inches| 22 inches|

### Solar Panel

Survey the installation site. For the solar panel to function, the sun should be directly visible from 10 AM - 3 PM, and not be obstructed by structures, railcars, or foliage.
Two mounting pounts are provided with 1/4"-20 threaded studs for the solar panel and light. Mount the solar panel on the side of the derail device that receives the most sun.

### Digging

Using a pickaxe, dig a path under the rail and around the ties for the liquid-tight tubing and controller stand.

### Mounting the Controller Stand

1. Center controller stand bracket on the tie
2. Move bracket towards rail as far as possible
3. Using at least 4 0.5" x 3" galvanized lag bolts with washers, attach the bracket to the tie
4. If not already attached, bolt the controller stand to the tie bracket
5. Ensure bolts are tightened, and that assembly is centered on the tie and square to the rail
6. Attach leveling feet using holes on bottom of bracket and tighten
7. Pre-load feet to prevent assembly from wobbling

### Light

1. Place the slotted base of the light assembly on to the threaded 

### Connecting the Light

1. Ensure that 5V jumpers are installed
2. Connect the light wires to terminals on the board as shown
3. Use a multimeter to test the connections

1. Center solar panel on spider bracket and fasten using provided M6 cage nuts
2. Bolt spider bracket, with solar panel attached, to solar panel mast
3. Place the slotted base of the solar panel assembly onto the threaded stud pattern on the side of the device that receives more sun
4. Adjust solar panel rotation to desired angle
5. Ensure the light is not casting a shadow on the solar panel
6. Thread washers and 1/4"-20 nuts onto base studs and tighten
7. Adjust solar panel tilt to desired angle and tighten bolts

`` Do not connect battery wire until all installation steps are complete ``

8. Feed wires through cable glands into controller enclosure
9. Connect the Solar Panel wires to terminals on the board as shown
11. Use a multimeter to test the connections

## 3.3 Sensor Installation

### For Flip-Style Derail

1. Locate bracket on side of derail
2. Move derailer side to side, to the nearest and furthest extent, making sure sensor is clear of moving parts
3. Ensure sensor will be clear of wheels
4. Grind paint off of mating face of sensor bracket before welding
5. Mount sensor to bracket with provided screws
6. Weld sensor and bracket assembly to derail 

### For Swing-Style Derail

``Stand for swing-style derail sensor provided by Marmon``

1. Locate bracket on stand 
2. Bolt bracket to stand

### Liquid-Tight tubing

``Liquid tight tubing provided by Marmon``

1. Measure between bracket to box
2. Cut tubing
3. Run cable through tubing from sensor to box
4. slide the bracket straight down on to the sensor
5. Move bracket forward and back to adjust
6. Once positioned, tighten top bolts to secure bracket
7. Pass sensor wire through cable gland into controller housing

8. Connect the sensor wires to terminals on the board as shown
9. Use a multimeter to test the connections

### Turning on the System

* Connect battery wire
* Controller will power up
