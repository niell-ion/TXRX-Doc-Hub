## 3.1 Setup

### Preparation

``Note: Limited installation instructions are provided. The controller, target plate mounting arm, and protective cover plates are installed by TXRX.``

Ensure proper PPE is equipped and all required tools are present before attempting to install the Switch Gap Detector. 

### Installing the sensor module

1. Start by installing the sensor module on the stock rail closest to the controller enclosure
2. Observe that the sensor module is properly connected to the controller enclosure
3. Ensure the switch is thrown in the direction opposite the stock rail to which the sensor will be mounted
4. Loosen the bolts on the toe clamp located on the top of the sensor housing
5. Fit the toe clamp over the base of the stock rail, parallel with the target plate bracket
6. Tighten the toe clamp bolts so that the sensor is securely fastened to the base of the rail

### Installing the target plate

1. Locate the target plate mounting arm with two bolt holes, welded to the switch rail
2. Without fully tightening, use the provided bolts to fasten the target plate to the arm
3. Ensure the target plate is parallel to the sensor module
4. Slowly throw the switch, bringing the target plate closer to the sensor module without causing them to touch
5. Move the target plate if necessary so that the switch can be fully thrown without touching the sensor
6. Without tightening the target plate bolts, proceed to calibration

## 3.2 Calibration

### Calibrating the gap offset

1. With the sensor module and target plate nearly touching
2. Use a ``1mm`` shim to 

### Setting the gap offset

1. Ensure that the sensor module securely tightened to the base of the stock rail and that the target plate is loosely bolted to the mounting arm
2. Slowly close the switch, taking ca
