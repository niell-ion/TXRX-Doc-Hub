## 2.1 Sensor Modules

The sensor module consists of electromagnetic displacement sensors enclosed in a cast aluminum housing. They monitor the switch point position by detecting the presence and relative distance of a target plate. 
Sensor modules are always fastened to the stock rail. They are hardwired via electrical conduit to the controller. Sensors modules must be calibrated to the correct target distance before use.
