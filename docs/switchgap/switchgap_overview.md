## 2.1 Sensor Modules

The sensor modules consist of electromagnetic displacement sensors enclosed in a cast aluminum housing. Each switch gap detector features two sensor modules, one for each switch position.

* They monitor the switch point position by detecting the presence and relative distance of a target plate
* Sensor modules are always fastened to the stock rail
* They are hardwired to the controller via electrical conduit
* Sensors modules must be calibrated to the correct target distance before use

## 2.2 Target Plates

Target plates are specially designed steel plates that can be detected by the sensor housing.

* Target plates are always fastened to the switch rail. 
* Target plates must be adjusted to the correct angle and spacing from the sensor module before use.
