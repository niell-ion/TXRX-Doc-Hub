## 2.1 Sensor Modules

The sensor modules consist of electromagnetic displacement sensors enclosed in a cast aluminum housing. Each switch gap detector features two, one for each switch position.

* Sensor modules are always fastened to the stock rail
* They monitor the switch point position by electromagnetically detecting the presence and relative distance of the target plate
* They are hardwired to the controller via electrical conduit
* Sensor modules must be position adjusted and calibrated before use

## 2.2 Target Plates

Target plates are specially designed steel plates that trigger a positive signal detected by the sensor housing.

* Target plates are always fastened to the switch rail
* Target plates must be position adjusted before use
* Target plates must be installed parallel to sensor modules

## 2.3 Controller

The controller includes the power supply, logic circuitry, communication systems, and diagnostic tools. Housed in a weathertight electronics enclosure, it features on-board buttons and a readout LCD for first-time setup or troubleshooting.

* Push buttons located on the controller board enable calibration mode
* Calibration mode allows manual adjustment of the sensors' target distance
* The readout LCD provides real-time distance sensor feedback for gap calibration
* Entering calibration mode changes the status light behavior from blinking to a continous state for postion feedback

## 2.4 Status Light

The status light sits atop a pole attached to the controller housting. It provides visual feedback that the switch is either closed or open/gapped by blinking either red or green during standard operation.

* A red light indicates the switch is gapped or open. If the switch is not actively being thrown, a red light indicates a switch gap exceeding safe tolerances
* A green light indicates that the switch is closed in either position, within a safe tolerance of the user-calibrated positon
* In calibration mode, the light will shine continuously to provide real-time distance feedback
