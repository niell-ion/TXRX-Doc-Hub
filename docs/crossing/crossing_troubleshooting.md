## 6.1 Mechanical Issues

### Gate Moves too Slow or too Fast

> Always wear a hard hat and steel-toed boots while adjusting counterweights to prevent injury

1. Check battery to ensure correct voltage level
2. Observe counterweight and record number of plates
3. Carefully remove counterweight retaining bolts
5. If gate is rising too slowly, remove counterweight plates one at a time
6. If gate is rising too fast, add counterweight plates one at a time
7. Reinstall counterweight retaining bolts before moving arm
8. Test with more or less weight until arm raises and lowers smoothly

### Gate Fails to Raise/Lower

## 6.2 Electrical Issues

### Crossing Has No Power

1. Ensure solar panel cables are connected
2. Check that solar panel is not shaded by arm [3.3 Solar Panel Setup](crossing_setup.md#3.3-solar-panel-setup)
3. Check that battery cables are connected and has charge
4. Check that controller 

### Remote Not Connecting

1. Ensure remote is charged by placing it in the wireless charging cradle
2. If remote doesn't wake after ``1 hour`` of charging, contact TXRX support
3. If remote wakes but doesn't have associated crossing, refer to [4.1 Remote Programming](crossing_setup.md#3.3-solar-panel-setup)
